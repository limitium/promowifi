            <p><b>Location</b>:
                Lipetsk, Lipetsk Region
            </p>

            <p><b>Processing capacity</b>:
                12.4 million tonnes of steel per year
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>Novolipetsk is the main production site of NLMK Group. It is the nucleus of the unified international
                NLMK Group. Today, around 18% of all Russian steel and around 80% of the Group’s entire steel
                production are manufactured at the Lipetsk plant.
            </p>

            <p>Novolipetsk’s state-of-the-art production process comprises all the technological stages, from
                processing raw materials to manufacturing high value added steel products. Since 2000, over RUB 21 billion has been invested in environmental protection. As a result, the plant has put a complete stop to the disposal of waste water in rivers and lakes, halved its atmospheric emissions, and begun removing the build-up of past industrial waste (95.7% recycling level). </p>

            <p>Novolipetsk is Lipetsk’s main employer, providing highly-paid employment for over 29,000 people from the city and the region.</p>

                        <p>Today, Novolipetsk offers Russian consumers unique metal goods which previously had to be imported into the country. For example, as part of its strategic partnership with OMK Group, Novolipetsk manufactures slabs for the production of large-diameter pipes. In a record space of time, specialists at the plant managed to set up production of steel slabs with more rigorous demands on the chemical content and macrostructure of the metal, in standard sizes that were new to Russia. </p>

                        <p>As a result, a completely Russian high-tech production chain was created as a substitute for imports, dealing with everything from mining and smelting to the manufacture of products important to the country. In less than two years of collaboration, Novolipetsk supplied OMK with over one million tonnes of steel slabs for the manufacture of large diameter pipes used in projects such as South Stream, Nord Stream, and Power of Siberia.</p>
