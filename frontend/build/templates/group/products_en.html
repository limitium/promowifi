                <p>
                    Thickness: <b>180 — 355mm</b><br/>

                </p>
                <h4>Usage</h4>

                <p style="font-size: 18px;">NLMK produces steel slabs with various chemical properties and in different sizes. The company uses slabs mainly in flat steel production at the Lipetsk plant, and also supplies them to the Group’s mills in Europe and the USA, as well as to other consumers in Russia and abroad. ‘Wide’ slabs are further converted into thick plates, including at NLMK’s subsidiaries in Europe – DanSteel and Clabecq.
                </p>

                <p style="font-size: 18px;">Today, NLMK offers Russian consumers unique metal goods which previously had to be imported into the country. For example, as part of its strategic partnership with OMK Group, Novolipetsk manufactures slabs for the production of large-diameter pipes. In a record space of time, specialists at the plant managed to set up production of steel slabs with more rigorous demands on the chemical content and macrostructure of the metal, in standard sizes that were new to Russia.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 18px;">
                    As a result, a completely Russian high-tech production chain was created as a substitute for imports, dealing with everything from mining and smelting to the manufacture of products important to the country. In less than two years of collaboration, Novolipetsk supplied OMK with over one million tonnes of steel slabs for the manufacture of large diameter pipes used in projects such as South Stream, Nord Stream, and Power of Siberia.
