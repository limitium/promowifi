                <p>Construction of a steel plant begins at the site of Lipetsk’s iron ore mines. The work, planned to take months, is completed within weeks. Workers do not leave the construction site for two or three shifts at a time, and people work weekends in order to build the country’s most state-of-the-art steel plant.</p>

                <p>As Russia joins World War II, the blast furnace shop and power plant are dismantled and the equipment sent to Chelyabinsk. The equipment that remains in Lipetsk is used to furnish orders for the frontline. It is not until 1947 that work begins to rebuild the plant on its previous site. It is essentially built from scratch, and in the shortest time possible. By 1951, two blast furnaces have been restored. </p>

Just one year later, the plant is the first in the USSR to begin production of anisotropic electrical steel using its own, unique technology. Then, in 1966, the plant becomes the first in the world to combine steel smelting in high-performance BOF shops with 100% continuous slab casting.</p>
